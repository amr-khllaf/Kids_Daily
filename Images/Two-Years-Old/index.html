    <h2 class="subhead">Kids from 2 Months to 2 Years</h2>

    <p class="fw-bold">What are the stages of child development:</p>
    <p>
      The stages of child development refer to the biological, psychological,
      and emotional changes that occur in a child from birth until the end of
      adolescence. During this period, the individual grows older and becomes
      more independent, acquiring the fundamental skills needed to make correct
      decisions that align with their environment, their parents' customs and
      traditions, or societal norms. Child development is a continuous process
      with a predictable sequence, although each child has a unique path. Not
      all children progress at the same rate, and each stage is influenced by
      prior developmental experiences.
    </p>
    <p class="fw-bold">Stages of newborn development (from 0 to 4 weeks):</p>
    <p>
      The newborn makes automatic movements in response to external stimuli at
      this stage. The newborn can see things close to their eyes, such as their
      parents' faces, recognize certain smells, move their head from side to
      side, and smile and cry to indicate their needs.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p class="fw-bold">
        Stages of infant development (from 4 weeks to 1 year):
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      During this stage, infants exhibit new developmental abilities. For
      example, a child between three to six months old can control their head
      movements and play with their hands together. They may also be able to sit
      without support, respond to their name, and babble between six to nine
      months of age. Between nine and twelve months, the child can crawl, stand
      with support, and pick up objects using their index finger and thumb.

    <p class="fw-bold">Stages of toddler development (from 1 to 2 years):</p>
    <p>
      Toddlers are children between the ages of one and three years. At this
      age, children exhibit routine behaviors, such as bedtime routines, which
      give them a sense of confidence and comfort. Although toddlers at this age
      need support and assistance, they can acquire the following skills:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Walking without help.</li>
      <li>Climbing stairs.</li>
      <li>Jumping from one place to another.</li>
      <li>Using a crayon.</li>
      <li>Drawing geometric shapes.</li>
      <li>Building a tower with two blocks.</li>
      <li>Following simple instructions.</li>
      <li>Using simple sentences.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="fw-bold">
      Tips and guidelines for dealing with the newborn stage:
    </p>
    <p>
      Parents should not only interact with their newborn based on their basic
      needs such as feeding and diaper changing, but also try to harness the
      child's natural abilities, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="fw-bold">Vision:</span> Parents can help the child develop
        their visual abilities by attempting to capture their attention and
        encourage eye movement by moving objects around them in different
        directions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="fw-bold">Hearing:</span> Babies can listen to sounds in
        early stages before birth, so talking to them or singing softly can have
        an impact on their auditory development.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="fw-bold">Touch:</span> Engaging in tactile interactions
        with the baby will contribute to the development of their sensory and
        emotional abilities.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Guidance For Dealing With The Toddler Stage</h2>

    <p>
      In this stage, especially at the age of two, the child will test the
      limits of their developing motor skills. The child may fail to reach or
      achieve their goals, leading to feelings of frustration or anger.
      Therefore, parents should closely monitor them and intervene when
      necessary, helping the child avoid negative behaviors.
    </p>
    <p class="fw-bold">
      Infant nutrition from the fourth month to the sixth month:
    </p>
    <p>
      Breast milk remains a primary source of nutrition for your child, but your
      child also becomes ready for solid food. This readiness is evident in
      their actions, such as reaching for the spoon or food from your hand.
      Here, you can start giving them mashed fruits with a spoon, and they will
      begin to accept the idea of swallowing and being fed solid foods.
    </p>

        alt="Cute Baby Playing with a toy "
      />
    </figure>

    <p class="fw-bold">
      Infant nutrition from the seventh month to the tenth month:
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, your child transitions to the finger food stage, where they can pick
      up and eat food with their hands, such as fruit slices. Additionally, they
      start drinking water from a sippy cup instead of a bottle. This transition
      marks a move from mashed foods to those they can feed themselves from a
      plate.
    </p>
    <p class="fw-bold">
      Infant nutrition from the tenth month to the first year:
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, your toddler becomes capable of self-feeding using a small plate and
      a plastic spoon. At this stage, the child can sit in a highchair designed
      for feeding and consume various foods such as pasta, rice, cheeses, and
      other nutritious foods. Their swallowing and chewing abilities become more
      developed. It's recommended to introduce them to adult-like utensils,
      especially if you're planning to wean them off the bottle, as this is the
      ideal time for it. From one year to a year and a half, the child starts
      expressing hunger and fullness cues, transitioning from a sippy cup to a
      regular cup to further develop their swallowing skills. They can also eat
      without needing to sit in a highchair designed for feeding. You can
      introduce meats, eggs, and cow's milk at this stage. They are now in the
      toddler stage, not infants.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p class="fw-bold">
      Infant nutrition from one and a half years to two years:
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, your child begins expressing their food needs through speech, such
      as naming foods and indicating if they want more or are full. They start
      using regular plates and spoons, and they express refusal to eat by
      spitting out food or playing with the plate during meals. They also start
      to show preferences for certain types of food.

    <p class="fw-bold">Social and emotional stages at two months old:</p>
    <p>
      Here are some ways you'll see your little one learning to bond with people
      around them at two months old:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>They can soothe themselves by sucking on their hands.</li>
      <li>They start smiling at others.</li>
      <li>They seek to look towards their parents.</li>
      <li>
        Engage in skin-to-skin contact with the baby, where the warmth of the
        body will comfort the child.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hold the baby close to your face and look into their eyes. This will
        help the baby learn to recognize people's features.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="fw-bold">Language and communication stages at two months old:</p>

    <p>How your little one engages with others and expresses their needs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They pay attention to sounds and turn their head towards them.</li>
      <li>They make cooing sounds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <span class="fw-bold">Parenting tips:</span>
      Engage in "conversations" with your baby when they make cooing sounds, by
      talking to them in a baby voice. This interaction is important to help the
      child develop language and communication skills.

        They can push their body with their hands when lying on their stomach,
        and they can lift their head.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <span class="fw-bold">Parenting tips:</span> Engage in tummy time with
      your baby by sitting in front of them and talking to them while they are
      lying on their stomach in front of you. Encourage them to move their head,
      arms, and legs by moving soft toys around them.
    </p>

    <p class="fw-bold">Things to be aware of:</p>
    <p>
      While every child grows differently from others, you should speak with a
      pediatrician if your two-month-old:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cannot grasp during breastfeeding or bottle feeding.</li>
      <li>
        Loses a lot of breast milk or formula from their mouth during feeding.
      </li>
      <li>Does not smile at people.</li>
      <li>Does not move their hands towards their mouth.</li>
      <li>Does not respond to loud noises.</li>
      <li>Does not track people or objects when they move.</li>
      <li>Is unable to lift their head while lying on their stomach.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By the time your child reaches two years old, they will be able to talk,
      walk, climb, jump, and run, filled with energy. They will have developed
      an expanding vocabulary and regularly acquire new words. They will be able
      to arrange things by their shape and color, and may show interest in
      toilet training. As your child grows more independent, they may show signs
      of rebellion and begin to push the boundaries set for them to explore the
      world around them. The child's brain develops significantly in the first
      two years of life.

    <h2>Social and Emotional Stages At Two Years Old</h2>

    <p>
      Here are some ways you'll see your little one learning to bond with people
      around them at two years old:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>They enjoy imitating the actions of adults and other children.</li>
      <li>They feel excited when in the company of other children.</li>
      <li>They become more independent and even more rebellious.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <span class="fw-bold">Parenting tips:</span>
      Create opportunities for engagement in play and conversations with your
      child. Playtime could be as simple as rolling a ball back and forth or
      letting the child handle their toys while you supervise. These kinds of
      activities can develop pre-social behaviors by instilling a sense of
      belonging and cooperation with others.
