    <h2 class="subhead">Kids From 3 Years to 6 Years</h2>

    <p>
      -Between the ages of 3-6 years old, children enter the stage where they
      begin formal education, such as enrolling in kindergarten. During this
      time, children learn skills that enhance their cognitive and physical
      abilities. Additionally, parents play a crucial role in assisting with
      daily routines, such as establishing designated times for play, physical
      activity, reading books, and so forth.
      <br />
      -If parents notice any developmental delays or unusual behaviors in their
      child, it is important for them to seek consultation with a specialized
      physician to evaluate the child's condition and provide appropriate
      support to stimulate their growth.
      <br />
      -This is the golden stage in human life, as it is during this period that
      children acquire an immense amount of knowledge that they may not learn
      throughout their entire lives.
      <br />
      -Children undergo significant development in all aspects during this
      stage, so it is essential for every caregiver to understand everything
      related to this stage and utilize it to the best advantage.

    <p class="fw-bold">Age Characteristics of Children 3-6 Years Old:</p>
    <ul>
      <p>Here are all the details summarized in bullet points for brevity:</p>
      <li>Rapid growth and development.</li>
      <li>
        By the end of this stage, the brain reaches 90% of its adult size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sensory development is complete, including vision, hearing, touch, and
        taste.
      </li>
      <li>Significant growth in hands and feet is noticeable.</li>
      <li>
        Forcing senses to perform tasks they're not ready for can lead to
        learning difficulties. For example, asking a 3 or 4-year-old to write
        may cause finger distortion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Children at this stage may not hear themselves, so they may not realize
        their mistakes. Therefore, repetition is essential, especially during
        playtime.
      </li>
      <li>They can differentiate between warm and cold sensations.</li>
      <li>They can identify colors and shapes.</li>
      <li>They can label objects with their names while closing their eyes.</li>
      <li>By age five, they can accurately identify pain.</li>
      <li>Vision development is complete.</li>
      <li>
        They can focus both eyes on a specific object for a good duration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Children begin to experience various emotions as a precursor to
        developing external social relationships or deeper interpersonal
        connections.
      </li>
      <li>
        All emotions are self-centered, such as fear, jealousy, anxiety, and
        others, and we will now explain them in detail.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <p class="fw-bold">Fear:</p>
      <li>The child cannot distinguish between reality and imagination.</li>
      <li>
        Children generally acquire their fears from their parents, family
        members, or their surrounding experiences.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is pathological fear that requires intervention to resolve, such
        as fear of things that are not frightening in reality, like spoons.
      </li>
      <li>
        Another natural fear experienced by all children at this stage includes
        fear of ghosts, darkness, or being alone.
      </li>
      <p class="fw-bold">Anxiety:</p>
      <li>
        This occurs due to fluctuations in the relationship between the child
        and their parents or due to the child being subjected to abuse or
        threats of abandonment or being left alone with strangers for a long
        time.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="fw-bold">Child at Age 3: Emotional Development</p>
    <p>
      The age of two to three years old is one of the most crucial periods for
      emotional development. During this time, children experience a wide range
      of emotions and begin to recognize the feelings of others. Tantrums are
      common and natural at this age because children are not yet able to
      express their other emotions, such as frustration and embarrassment.
      Children start to understand how their behavior can affect their parents
      and begin to grasp how their parents' behavior can impact them.
    </p>
    <p class="fw-bold">Child at Age 3: Social Development</p>

    <ul>
      <p>
        Children aged two to three years can also engage in several social
        activities. Here are some of them:
      </p>
      <li>Playing with other children.</li>
      <li>Preferring to play with children of the same gender.</li>
      <li>Protesting when asked to share toys.</li>
      <li>Using a crayon.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="fw-bold">Child at Age 3: Language and Speech Development</p>
    <ul>
      <p>
        Children aged three can also engage in various cog nitive activities
        that indicate their cognitive development. These include:
      </p>
      <li>
        Recognizing and identifying common objects and pictures by pointing at
        them.
      </li>
      <li>The ability to count using numbers.</li>
      <li>The ability to imitate animal movements.</li>
      <li>Understanding similarities and differences.</li>
      <li>Identifying the gender of children in pictures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="fw-bold">Tips to Aid the Development of a 3-Year-Old Child:</p>
    <ul>
      <p>Here are some tips that may help support and develop your child:</p>
      <li>Give your child individual attention as much as possible.</li>
      <li>Talk to your child and ask them about what they are doing.</li>
      <li>
        Provide your child with building toys, toy cars, animals, and other
        playthings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Encourage your child to explore while supervising to ensure their
        safety.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="fw-bold">
      These are some stages of a child's growth before school (from 4 to 6
      years):
    </p>
    <p>
      The preschool stage typically ranges from three to five years old,
      characterized by an increased ability to acquire fine motor skills. During
      this stage, a child may be capable of throwing a ball over their head,
      jumping, standing on one foot for 10 seconds or more, drawing a person
      with features, attending to toilet needs, dressing themselves, and
      engaging in longer conversations.
    </p>
    <p class="fw-bold">Tips and guidance for the pre-school stage include:</p>
    <p>
      The child's growth should be enhanced through parental training, as
      parents play a significant role in a child's life in terms of social
      upbringing and development. Having both parents present with the child can
      lead to increased stability in the child's life, thus encouraging parental
      involvement during the ages of 3-6 years, which is the stage when children
      begin schooling, such as enrolling in kindergarten. During this period,
      children learn skills that develop their mental and physical abilities.
      Additionally, parents play a role in helping to establish daily routines,
      including designated times for play, physical activity, reading books, and
      more.
    </p>

    <p class="fw-bold">
      This is what you can expect from your child in terms of physical
      development at the age of 6 years:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Losing the first set of baby teeth.</li>
      <li>Sharp vision - as good as adults.</li>
      <li>Increased sense of body awareness.</li>
      <li>
        Better sense of balance, though sometimes coordination may be lacking.
      </li>
      <li>Jumping, hopping, and walking steadily on low curbs.</li>
      <li>Grasping a ball with hands without tucking it into the chest.</li>
      <li>Learning to ride a bicycle easily.</li>
      <li>Writing and drawing with more accuracy.</li>
      <li>Dressing oneself and tying and untying shoelaces.</li>
      <li>Moving in time with music or rhythm.</li>
      <p class="fw-bold">
        There are other aspects of physical development such as health and
        nutrition. With the child being in school, opportunities for physical
        exercise and outdoor activities may decrease, increasing the risk of
        weight gain. Therefore, it's important for parents to encourage regular
        exercise and outdoor activities. Enjoy sports together and explore new
        places as a family, go biking, and ensure the entire family gets a
        balanced, healthy diet.
